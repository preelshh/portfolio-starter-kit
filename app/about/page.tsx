        About Me
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Hi, I’m Priyal Sharma — a junior at UCLA studying Statistics, Data Science,
        and Computer Science.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        I’m drawn to this field because I genuinely love math — especially
        calculus and linear algebra. To me, machine learning is one of the most
        exciting applications of math: it takes abstract theory and turns it
        into models that can predict real patterns in the world.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Outside of school, I love art, animated shows and movies, reading comics,
        and playing the piano.
